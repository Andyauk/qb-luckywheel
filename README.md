Fork of esx_tpnrp_luckywheel to work with [QBCore](https://github.com/qbcore-framework). Original work from [izMystic](https://github.com/izMystic/qb-luckywheel) and I finished it, fixed some bugs, and added more features.

## Features
- Working Lucky Wheel and spinning
- Working car spawn + spinning
- Working car platform spinning
- Implemented working wall television animations
- Dynamically loads and unloads the vehicle/pedestal, televisions, and wheel when inside the casino interior based on interior id
- Added support for 3rd eye interaction
- Added config option to actually award the car or not to the person, or just send them they email they won it.
